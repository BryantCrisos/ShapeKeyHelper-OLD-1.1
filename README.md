# ShapeKeyHelper-OLD-1.1
This is an old version of J_Ott's ShapeKey Helper tools That works in Blender 3.6.5!
(The newer updated versions throw errors & I'm no programmer to fix them D:)

Installation: All you'll need to do is drag the shapeKeyHelper_menu.py into your blender addons folder. 
You'll then see it in your Preferences> Addons > 'Mesh:ShapeKey Helpers

How to use: The shapeKeys Helper menu should be located in the data tab. There you'll be able to press the function you
want after selecting the model you'd like to apply the modifiers and keep the shapeKeys. 

Known Issues: If You have merge and clipping selected on mirror modifier your shapeKeys are likely to get messed up. 
Disable both merge & clip then run click on the shapeKey options you'd like to use.
